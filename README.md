# Lethal Reloaded

**Lethal Reloaded** began as a modpack created primarily for myself and a few friends. However, as the modpack surpassed
500
downloads, I realized it had captured the interest of a broader community. With that in mind, I‚Äôd like to share more
about what this modpack offers and its original intent.

___

## Purpose

One of the main challenges with large modpacks that include over 100 mods is the significant drop in
performance‚Äîfrequent FPS drops, freezes, and error-filled logs can seriously dampen the experience. Lethal Reloaded was
crafted with a focus on maintaining solid performance and maximizing fun, rather than simply piling on mods at the cost
of stability, which often leads to crashes, long load times, and the frustration of frequent restarts.

This is my first modpack, but I'll do my best to keep it updated while ensuring it stays
performant. If you‚Äôre interested, you can access the source files and suggest changes via the GitHub link at the top of
the page.

sanctuary for those seeking shelter from the icy wilderness above. Yet, as communication with the surface was lost, the
bunker became a tomb, its halls haunted by the ghosts of those who once sought solace within its walls.
