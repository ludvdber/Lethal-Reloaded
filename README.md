A carefully curated modpack for **Lethal Company** focused on enhancing gameplay while maintaining stability and performance.

___

## Purpose

One of the main challenges with large modpacks that include over 100 mods is the significant drop in
performance—frequent FPS drops, freezes, and error-filled logs can seriously dampen the experience. Lethal Reloaded was
crafted with a focus on maintaining solid performance and maximizing fun, rather than simply piling on mods at the cost
of stability.
