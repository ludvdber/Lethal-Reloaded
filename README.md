# Lethal Reloaded

**Lethal Reloaded** began as a modpack created primarily for myself and a few friends. However, as the modpack surpassed
500
downloads, I realized it had captured the interest of a broader community. With that in mind, I’d like to share more
about what this modpack offers and its original intent.

## Purpose

One of the main challenges with large modpacks that include over 100 mods is the significant drop in
performance—frequent FPS drops, freezes, and error-filled logs can seriously dampen the experience. Lethal Reloaded was
crafted with a focus on maintaining solid performance and maximizing fun, rather than simply piling on mods at the cost
of stability, which often leads to crashes, long load times, and the frustration of frequent restarts.

This is my first modpack, but I'll do my best to keep it updated while ensuring it stays
performant. If you’re interested, you can access the source files and suggest changes via the GitHub link at the top of
the page.

## Features

**Lethal Reloaded** comes with a variety of enhancements to improve your gameplay:

- **Support Lethal Company V64**
- **Resolution & FOV Adjustments:** The modpack automatically sets the game resolution to 1920x1080 and adjusts the FOV
  for
  optimal viewing.
- **Shop Additions:** New items have been added to the in-game store.
- **Increased Loot:** Enjoy more loot.
- **New Ambient Sounds:** Increase Fear Factor.
- **Vega, the Voice Assistant**
- **Bug Fixes & Optimizations:** Several bugs have been fixed, and optimizations have been made to improve performance.
- **New Perks & Cosmetics:** Discover new perks and cosmetics.
- **More Monsters:** Face off against a wide array of new monsters, including Slenderman, the Skinwalker (who mimics
  your
  friends' voices), the Immortal Snail, FNAF creatures, SCP entities, Herobrine, and many more.
- **Enhanced Dungeons:** Explore dungeons with more interior.
- **Additional Moons:** Over 20 new moons have been added.
- **Quality of Life Improvements:** Numerous QoL enhancements have been implemented to make your experience smoother and
  more
  enjoyable.

## Installation Instructions

Installing Lethal Reloaded is straightforward:

1. Download and install the r2modman software.
2. Search for LethalReloaded within the application.
3. Download the modpack and you're ready to play!

##### Note:

**Sometimes the download might appear to get stuck at 100%. Don’t worry—this is normal. The modpack is still
downloading, and after a brief wait (depending on your download speed), the screen will disappear, and the installation
will be complete.**

## A special thanks to

**SNEUS** and **Diduknow** for testing the modpack, and to **Kaze** for being a Skinwalker for so long. I still don’t
know if **Kaze** is alive or dead

# I hope you'll have a lot of fun!
